## Assignment - Tidying and Transforming Data

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="R interface", out.width = '100%'}
#bringing the data input in a picture form
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maharjansudhan/DATA607/master/schedule.JPG")
```

library(knitr)


The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations. Your task is to:

(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above. You're
encouraged to use a "wide" structure similar to how the information appears above, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.

```{r}
#getting the csv data from github
schedule <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maharjansudhan/DATA607/master/schedule.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
schedule
```


(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

```



```{r}
#VIEW THE DATA AND CREATE NAMES
str(schedule)
```

```{r}
#for a better view
names(schedule)[1:2] <- c('AIRLINES','STATUS')
schedule
```

```{r}
#trying to gather data in a meaningful way
Tidydata<-gather(schedule, "CITY","FLIGHT",3:7)
Tidydata
```

```{r}
X<-spread(Tidydata,STATUS,FLIGHT)
X
```

```{r}
#have a overview of your data if its in correct format or not
glimpse(X)
```


(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
```{r}
#calculate the ratio of the arrival delays and show it with all the other information
X %>% mutate(ratio=delayed/(delayed+`on time`)) 
```


(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your homework submission:
??? The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
??? The URL for your rpubs.com web page.
